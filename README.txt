#RedChair - FFXIV AFKer Instructions

Before running the AFKer ( [Delete] ) please tab into the game,
the run/stop hotkey only works when the game is the active window.

Keys that open menus will stop you from getting kicked,
no need to move around or anything, be sure to use multiple 
different keys to avoid detection.

[F1] and [Home] hotkeys will work when tabbed out.

To edit key binds that will be used:
1. Edit through the textbox or create binds.txt (case sensitive) 
   in the same folder as the .exe
2. Enter each key, seperate each one with a space
3. Press Save and Reload button

- See list for key names: tobu.co/redchair

Hotkeys:
[Delete] to run or stop the AFKer
[F1] to close the program
[Home] to reload the program

Known bugs:
Spamming the run/stop toggle will cause the program to hitch.
To fix you must find the program in the system tray to close it.
