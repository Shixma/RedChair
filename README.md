### RedChair - FFXIV AFKer Instructions

Before running the AFKer `[Delete]` please tab into the game,
the run/stop hotkey only works when the game is the active window.


Keys that open menus will stop you from getting kicked,
no need to move around or anything, be sure to use multiple 
different keys to avoid detection.

`[F1]` and `[Home]` hotkeys will work when tabbed out.

###### To edit key binds that will be used:
1. Edit through the textbox or create binds.txt (case sensitive) 
   in the same folder as the .exe
2. Enter each key, seperate each one with a space
3. Press Save and Reload button

- See list for key names: [tobu.co/redhchair](https://tobu.co/redchair)

###### Hotkeys:
`[Delete]` to run or stop the AFKer

`[F1]` to close the program

`[Home]` to reload the program


----------------------------------------------------------


###### Known bugs:
Spamming the run/stop toggle will cause the program to hitch.
To fix you must find the program in the system tray to close it.



###### Warning
I am not responsible for anything that might happen to your account when using this. Use at your own risk. This program is in a bit of a grey area in regards to TOS, inputs will be flagged as synthetic but it shouldnt matter as there are many legitimate reasons for synthetic inputs such as disibility (only way to make key presses look truly real is to use something like AutoHotInterception that sends inputs from a driver, but that also has its own downsides)
